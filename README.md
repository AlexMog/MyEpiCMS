MyEpiCMS
========

MyEpiCMS is a small and light CMS (Content Management System) API (Application Programming Interface) who provide a core where you can add plugins and templates.
With this plugins, you can create many things:
- Page gestionnary
- Download methods
- Administration, etc...

We will need some programmers to help us and test our application (and create plugins, maby :))

You want to have MySQL? Just create a simple plugin who connects to a database ;) -you can use our MySQL class helper-


OpenSource FTW!
